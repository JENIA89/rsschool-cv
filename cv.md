## About me

My name is Eugene and I'm trying to find my first job. I'm learning
JS/React. I really like programming and I'm going to become a strong
developer. I'm a hard-working and honest team player. I'm always
willing to learn new skills. I have an active lifestyle. As for my hobbies,
I like bicycling, swimming, boxing, and reading books. During my free
time, I prefer to improve my skills via self-education
